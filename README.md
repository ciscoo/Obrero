# Obrero (Worker)

The current PHP class provided by professor Knautz for use in the Volga project is not  up to date with today's standards. It makes use of the [original](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mysql.php) MySQL API. This API was deprecated as of PHP 5.5.0 and should **not** be used. This class aims to replace and teach PHP standards.

## Quickstart

Ensure you have at minimum PHP 5.4.0.

1. Clone the repo: `$ git clone https://github.com/ciscoo/mateo.io.git`
2. Fill in the login creditials for **your** mysql database for the `$config` array variable.
3. Test connection.
